<div class="w3-container">
<p>In 2016, I wanted to learn programming so I went on a coding spree and built a bunch of front end web projects.
  All the following projects were built within 20 days from September 21, 2016 to October 12, 2016.
  This is a little journey through my process.
  I learned everything here from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">Free Code Camp</a></p>

    <h3>Bill Watterson Tribute Page</h3>
    <p>My very first website. It only had simple html and css, but still took me hours to get right.</p>

    <h3>Random Quote Generator</h3>
    <p>My second website. It generates a new quote everytime you hit a button.
      It's here that I started playing around with javascript,
      using jquery to call an api and manipulate the dom.
    </p>
    <p>I was so proud of that css color shift animation.</p>

    <h3>Wiki Search</h3>
    <p>This site took a little more javascript and css.
      It was tough figuring out how to loop through the search results and have them be properly formated.</p>

    <h3>Twitch Fan Site</h3>
    <p>It takes a whole whopping 57 lines of javascript to power this baby.
      It's here that I started doing things like error checking when fetching
      data from the api.</p>

    <p>I still love the aesthic of this one.
      It was around here that I discovered the materialize css framework,

    <h3>Pomodoro Clock</h3>
    <p>This is a little clock utility. When you are procrastinating, starting is the
      hardest part. Once you are working, most people get into the flow of things
      and don't mind work so much. But starting is killer. So you trick yourself
      into starting by promising to only work for a short amount of time (say 25 minutes), then
      giving yourself a break. Breaking work into 25 minute segments is called the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro Technique</a>.</p>

    <h3>Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>
    <p>Play tic-tac-toe against the computer! And unfortunately, you will <i>never</i> be able to win.</p>
    <p>
      My javascript skills really improved while coding this.
      This was my first attempt at algorithmic thinking. I had to plot out the moves, and come up with
      an easy to code strategy that would always win or tie.
    </p>
    <p>I also included some cool new css features, like modal dialog boxes.</p>

    <h3>Github Markdown Preview</h3>
    <p>
      This was my first react app. Quite a step up from just using jquery to do dom manipulation.
      I also used newer ES6 javascript features in my code and thus used babel to convert it
      to backwards compatible javascript. Along with starting to use sass for css preprocessing,
      I had to learn a lot of new tools at this point.

    <h3>Game of Life</h3>
    <p>
      This is a simulation called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life"> Conway's Game of Life</a>
      after the mathemetician who invented it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cells flip on or off, (alive or dead) based off of how many cells around them are on.
      It is meant to simulate a bacterial colony. If a cell has too many neighboring cells
      that are also alive, it dies due to overpopulation. But if a cell has too few neighbors, it
      dies as it can't reproduce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try making a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glider_(Conway%27s_Life)">glider</a> for good fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project really shows the strength of react. Having each cell manage it's own state based on event calls
      really simplifies the code.
